# 20HH

## Overview
20HH is a chess engine written in [Go](https://go.dev). Its name is a combination of the "holy hell" meme from r/AnarchyChess and the 20XX copypasta from *Super Smash Bros. Melee*:
> The year is 20XX. Everyone plays Fox at TAS levels of perfection. Because of this, the winner of a match depends solely on port priority. The Rock Paper Scissors metagame has evolved to ridiculous levels due to it being the only remaining factor to decide matches. Humanity has reached its pinnacle. The low tier peasants are living in poverty. It seems nothing can stop the great leader of 20XX, Aziz “Hax” Al-Yami, and his army, the Fox monks who live in great monasteries where they levitate while TASing Fox with one hand, and winning tournaments with the other. The tournament metagame has gotten to this point where everything is played out to theoretical perfection, so tournament goers play Rock Paper Scissors for port priority, and that’s the game.

> The leaders of the anti-20XX movement aim to keep 20XX from coming. These warriors include Juan “Hungrybox” DeBiedma, Kevin “PewPewU” Toy, Kevin “PPMD” Nanney, and Jeffery “Axe” Williamson. They are all fighting to keep the apocalypse at bay, the Fox apocalypse. But their efforts are futile. Their silly Marths, Pikachus, Falcos, and Jigglypuffs are no match for Fox, the only viable character in Super Smash Bros. Melee for the Nintendo GameCube. Try as you will, but 20XX is coming. Or maybe, it’s already here.
